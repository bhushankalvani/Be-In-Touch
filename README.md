# Be-In-Touch
The BIT Project (Be In Touch). BIT is the a project that provides a sharing interface between an organization and its employees or between faculty and students. Contains an App and a Website.
"BITAPP" - Application (Platform - Cordova)
"BITWEB" - Website (PHP)

The project contains the php function to add, delete, upload and remove directories and files. Also it contains the function to traverse the directory structure recursively. This traversal function can be found for both, PHP and JAVASCRIPT individually in the WEB and APP directories respectively.

Being new to JAVASCRIPT and ANGULAR JS, the app portion of the project extensively uses JAVASCRIPT XMLHTTP requests to fetch the data and not the APP-FACTORY structure of ANGULAR, but I will try and update the new improved ANGULAR version soon. The layout of the application contains a slider menu from the right. The javascript for the same can be found in BITAPP/js directory, named "slideout.js" and "slideout-min.js". These scripts are not mine and rights go to the respective owner.
